Instinct
========

Instinct is an intelligent on-page editor plugin for Wordpress 3.5. Instinct automatically integrates with most themes to assist in a simple plug 'n' play installation. It's extendable too, so plugin developers can add on-page editor functionality easily to complement their core features.

I'm no where near a stable release yet, but posts and pages are mostly editable (if a little rough looking).

### Current working features (edge branch)

- [X] Extendable on-page UI elements or "Hatches" 
- [X] Post / Page Title Hatch
- [X] Post / Page Content Hatch
- [X] Native WP Editor Support
- [X] On-page media library

### Installation

- Clone edge branch into wp-content/plugins
- Activate plugin in Wordpress
